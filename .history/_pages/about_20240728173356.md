<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a 3rd year undergraduate majoring in computational mathematics at Peking University.

My research interests include neural machine translation, computer vision, and scientific machine learning. I have published papers on various topics, including high-dimensional PDE solvers and diffusion models.
