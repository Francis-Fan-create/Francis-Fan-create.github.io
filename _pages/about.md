<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a 3rd year undergraduate majoring in computational mathematics at Peking University.

My research interests include scientific machine learning, diffusion model, high dimensional PDE, contextual bandit and QMC.

Here is my [CV](My_Resume_2025_4.pdf).
