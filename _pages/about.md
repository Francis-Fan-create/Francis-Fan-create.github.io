<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a 3rd-year undergraduate in Computational Mathematics at Peking University.  
My research lies at the intersection of high-dimensional PDEs, simulation-calibrated scientific ML, stochastic processes & diffusion models, and quantum/non-equilibrium Markov dynamics. I build theory-backed algorithms (MLP / MLMC / lifting) and scale them to high-dimensional experiments.

Here is my [CV](My_Resume_2025_4.pdf).

# üî• News

**Accelerating NESS sampling on Quantum Markov Chains via Second-Order Lifting** ‚Äî *Jul 2025 ‚Äì Present*  
- **Supervisors:** [Prof. Jianfeng Lu](https://sites.math.duke.edu/~jianfeng/) (Duke)  
- **Overview:** Designed a second-order lifting framework to accelerate sampling of Non-Equilibrium Steady States (NESS) for Lindbladian dynamics including Lamb-shift Hamiltonians.  
- **Key contributions:**  
  - Developed lifting constructions that increase effective spectral gap for dissipative quantum dynamics under realistic Lindbladian models.  
  - Applied *hypocoercivity* techniques and flow-Poincar√© inequalities to derive rigorous lower and upper bounds on relaxation times for lifted processes.  
- **Impact:** Provides a theoretically grounded and practically implementable path to faster NESS sampling for quantum statistical problems and quantum control.

**Continuous-State Contextual Bandit with Pessimism Regularization** ‚Äî *Aug 2024 ‚Äì Present*  
- **Supervisor:** [Prof. Ying Jin](https://ying531.github.io/) (Harvard)  
- **Overview:** Extended pessimism regularization to continuous state and action spaces with function approximation.  
- **Key contributions:**  
  - Formulated a continuous-action pessimism objective compatible with common function approximators.  
  - Proved suboptimality bounds **without** the standard uniform overlap assumption by developing concentration inequalities adapted to policies with continuous actions.  
- **Impact:** Bridges theoretical pessimism principles and practical continuous action bandit learning, relevant to safe RL and policy estimation in continuous environments.

**Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning (SCaSML) for High-Dimensional PDEs** ‚Äî *Jun 2024 ‚Äì Apr 2025*  
- **Supervisors:** [Prof. Yiping Lu](https://2prime.github.io/), Dr. Yan Sun (Northwestern / Georgia Tech)  
- **Overview:** Proposed SCaSML, a pipeline that uses simulation-based estimators to calibrate surrogate PINN solutions and correct bias via Multilevel Picard (MLP) style calibration and randomized MLMC.  
- **Key contributions:**  
  - Derived theoretical complexity and convergence improvements showing better scaling in dimension than vanilla PINNs for a class of semilinear/parabolic PDEs.  
  - Designed a family of simulation-calibrated estimators and proved rate improvements by quantifying bias/variance tradeoffs under MLP corrections.  
  - Scaled numerical validation to several 100-dimensional benchmark PDEs, providing reproducible code and experiments: [github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML](https://github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML.git).  
- **Impact:** Demonstrates a viable route for inference-time/scalable PDE solving using theory-informed ML surrogates ‚Äî of direct interest to groups working on scientific ML and high-dimensional computation.

**Flow-Calibrated RL for Transition Path Sampling** ‚Äî *Feb 2024 ‚Äì Jun 2024*  
- **Supervisors:** [Prof. Yiping Lu](https://2prime.github.io/), [Dr. Dinghuai Zhang](https://zdhnarsil.github.io/) (NYU / Mila)  
- Reformulated transition-path sampling as stochastic optimal control and developed continuous Soft Actor-Critic and GFlowNet variants guided by flow-based calibration. (Slides & notes: [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/pzcgkgrjxpys#477484))
